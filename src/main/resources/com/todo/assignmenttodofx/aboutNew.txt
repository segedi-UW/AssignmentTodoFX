<-- 3.5.0 --> AutoUpdate - 9/25/2021

* Added Automatic detection of updates and an automatic
  installation process of these updates!!!

* Removed the download button

The main thing in the way of me implementing something like
this in the past was lack of knowledge, and lack of a
spot to upload - luckily GitHub has once again proven
to be the best software possibly ever developed. I found
out that GitHub serves websites for you for FREE, so
thanks to that I can do stuff like this.

<--/ 3.5.0 /-->

<-- 3.4.0 --> Dates, and Category load fix - 9/23/2021

* Fixed Categories (both parser, saver, and indexes :| )
* Categories can now have spaces - but cannot be blank nor
  include commas still
* Added dates to the patch notes

<--/ 3.4.0 /-->

<-- 3.3.0 --> Categories and FXML

* Added categories, since that was a requested feature - if you have
  any features in mind please let me know, and I will get back to you
  when I implement them.

* Reimplemented mnemonics because certain commands would not run
  due to having alternate meanings when text fields were focused
  (think for example Ctrl+A acting as a select all button for
  text in TextArea).

* Added notification for when you mute - that way if you use the
  mnemonic you actually know if the program is muted or not.

* Added a ResourceParser (that takes into account file vs jar access)
  so resources are now scalable

* Completely revamped how the scene is built - now primarily uses fxml
  and FXMLLoader's. Much easier to spruce up the look of now, and you
  will notice that the program is already looking cleaner.

* I misspelled default in "AssignmentTodo-Default.tdo", so I
  automatically converted it for you!

Note that this automatic conversion may be removed in a couple updates,
and after then if for some reason you have not updated till then, this
can be easily fixed by simply importing the misspelled default file from
your user directory. On Windows simply go to your default drive
(usually your "C:" drive) then click "users" then your username directory, then click
"AssignmentTodo", and it should be in there. Note that the auto conversion
will delete the previous file if it successfully loaded the file. I will
mention if I remove it in the patch notes, and of course feel free to contact
me if something happens. I have tested scripts to automatically fix the save
files and doing so would be very easy. Of course a script to rename a single
file is not necessary.

* Switched the way the patch notes are ordered so that the new stuff is on top
  if you have not yet noticed. Also added patch note headers.

Coding News:
Switched to Intellij as my primary IDE no regrets, it is awesome (loving Vim Emulator).
More code optimization ;)

<--/ 3.3.0 /-->

<-- 3.2.0 --> Log and AssignmentTodo directory

* Added a log file for standard error and console input for debugging

NOTE the log is cleared every time the program starts for a small
memory footprint, so if the program crashes, send the log to me
at aj.segedi@gmail.com BEFORE starting up the program again.

* Changed default file location to be within a directory - it will
  auto copy over don't worry
* Massively revamped code - more efficient and easier to work with
* Added autoNotifications and a preference for them to trigger

<--/ 3.2.0 /-->

<-- 3.1.2 --> UI Tweaks and Save Bug

* Added labels for both the loaded file and if the project has been saved
* Program no longer prompts for save on exit if it has been saved already

* Added option to turn off automatically loading the default file, and button
  to easily load it if wanted (see preferences and files respectively).

* Changed the way that reminders are rendered to make them more readable
  and pleasing to the eye

* Fixed bug where reminders were saved with the same time as the assignment
  was due instead of the time for the reminder

<--/ 3.1.2 /-->

<-- 3.0.0 --> FIRST UPDATE!

Hey there! Welcome to AssignmentTodo! This is the first installation 
where I have an about page, which you may or may not know about.
In any case, I am very excited to be sharing with you this new installation
with its own brand spanking new features to keep you up to date with all 
your tasks.

* New default file system (and import button in files)

If you have stuff in the current default file, no need to worry,
simply import it. There is a new default file system, which
means that you can move your AssignmentTodo.jar anywhere you want
to without worrying about moving the default file - in fact you
won't even have to worry about dealing with it directly. If
you ever do want to load it, it is in your user root directory.

* Saved Preferences

Little of quality of life here - tired of unselecting the military
time option? I hear ya, so now that bit and other options are saved
automatically - no need to keep unchecking them each time you load
this bad boi up. It also means that you DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
THIS PAGE POPPING UP EACH TIME YOU OPEN AssignmentTodo! That's
right, it will only open if you download a NEW version! If you
want to reread this page (or check version), use the about button
in AssignmentTodo menu.

* Notification Sounds (and mute button -> preference)
* Toggleable notifications
* Multiple different notification sounds for you to choose from

* Some code cleanup and removal for the depreciated commandline
interface (no need to mention but hey whatever)

* Little of optimization
* Implemented automatic Calendar updates and task updates 
  (no need to close the program and reopen it on a new day).
* Overcame two day struggle to decode wav files - turns out the fat jar builder 
  program I have been using was corrupting the .wav files due to an option I 
  selected. It was a ONE line fix...
  
* Implemented Key Accelerators (you know the ctrl+a keys etc.) they are
  listed on the Menus

<--/ 3.0.0 /-->

That about concludes the patch notes!
Hope you guys like the program, and perhaps I have worked out most of the 
kinks in this. Let me know if you need any help, or have suggestions.
Thanks for checking this program out, I really appreciate it!

Regards,
AJ S
